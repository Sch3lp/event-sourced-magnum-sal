# Magnum Sal
A 2-4 player game by Marcin Krupiński and Filip Miłuński. Condensed rules by Eric Postpischil, [http://edp.org/](http://edp.org/).

## Introduction
Goal: Make the most money by extracting salt and selling it to the castle.  
All money, salt, and tools are public.  
**Chain Rule:**
* Moving a miner may not break a chain (empty a space between miners) from the mine entrance to any miner in
the mine, except a miner may be moved out of a chamber when no salt remains in it or beyond in its row.

## Setup
Place the mineshaft vertically below the mine entrance on the game board.  
Shuffle the mine chambers marked I, II, and III separately.  
Place the I/II/III chambers in rows at depths 2/4/6 on the mine shaft, respectively, half to left of shaft, half to right.  
Shuffle the tool cards.  
Put 2 brown cubes and 1 green cube in the market spaces marked for them.  
Give each player 4 miners of a color (5 in a 2-player game) and 1 brown salt. (More may be hired, up to 10 total.)  
Choose a start player. Give the start player 10zł, the second player 12zł, the third 14zł, and the fourth 16zł.  

## Reference
### Moving Miners
Once a miner is in the castle queue, it must remain in the queue until it reaches the castle.  
Tired miners may not be moved, whether within the mine, to assistant spaces, or to the castle queue.  
Miners may be moved to assistant spaces and to mine spaces from any location except the castle queue.  
Visiting a building to perform its action, other than the Castle, does not require use of a miner.  

### Tools
Each tool may be used once per phase. Upon using a tool, turn it facedown to mark it used.  
Multiple tools may be used in a turn and within an action.  
**Rope:** When placing or moving a miner in the mine, place or move an additional miner in the mine.  
You may decide whether to use the rope after placing or moving the initial miner.  
**Pickaxe:** When extracting salt, add 1 to strength (number of salt cubes that can be extracted).  
**Bucket:** Move 1 water from a chamber with one of your miners to an adjacent chamber (not a shaft section).  
Water may be moved into a chamber that has not yet been revealed.  
**Cart:** When extracting salt, move any number of cubes through 1-2 adjacent chambers or sections without paying.  
The authors recommend limiting cart capacity to 2 cubes per use. (Additional cubes moved must be paid for.)  
**Food:** Wake 1-2 tired miners. (They may be in different chambers.)  
**Commercial Privilege:** When visiting the market, buy for 1 less, sell for 1 more, or sell into a full space.  
Salt sold into a full space earns the lowest price (not 1 more) and is returned to the bank.  
The privileges may be used during both market transactions.  
**Royal Privilege:** When visiting the castle, put the miner at the head of the line (left circle).  

## Magnum Sal
### Start of Phase
Shuffle the stack of 8 royal orders for the phase (I, II, or III) and stack them on the space with the crown.  
Turn over 3 orders for 2-3 players or 4 orders for 4 players and place them in the spaces in the castle.  
Put a brown disk for counting royal orders in space 0.  
Put a brown disk for counting available workers in the inn in the space marked for the number of players.  
Stack 7 tool cards facedown in the workshop (top-right of board). Deal 3 face-up to the left.  

### Play (clockwise in rounds until the end of the phase)
#### Castle
Each of the player’s miners in the castle line moves 1 space closer. Each miner that reaches the castle fills an order:
* Choose any open order, give the salt indicated to the bank, and receive the payment indicated and the order tile.
* If the player cannot fill an order, pay 3zł or any 1 salt to the bank. If not possible, surrender all money.
* Return the miner to the player. Move the royal order counter. Reveal a new order, if any remain.
* If there is an assistant at the castle, give them 1zł from the bank per order filled.

#### Actions
Each player plays any 1 action in the first round of the phase and any 2 actions (may be same) in later rounds.
Place or move a miner into the mine from anywhere but the castle queue. Obey the Chain Rule.
* Miners may be in shaft sections and mine chambers with any other miners.
* If the miner enters a new chamber, turn the chamber tile face-up and fill it with the indicated salt and water.

#### Extract salt from one mine chamber
* Extract salt up to the number of non-tired miners in the chamber plus tool assists minus water in the chamber.
* Transport the salt to the surface. Pay 1zł per salt per space used to any one miner there.
    * Payment for multiple salt cubes may be split among multiple players. Using one’s own miners is free.
* Each miner that worked in the chamber, including holding back water, becomes tired. Lay them on their sides.
    * Tired miners may not move or extract salt but may help transport salt to the surface.

#### Place a miner in an unoccupied assistant space by a building (none at inn). Obey the Chain Rule.
Miners remain in assistant spaces until the owner removes them or the phase ends.

#### Visit a building and perform its action. The same building may not be visited twice in one turn.
* Inn: Hire a worker at the currently shown price. Move marker to the next higher price or, after 8zł, off the track.
* Workshop: Buy a tool at its shown price. Slide remaining tools left and reveal a new tool if stack is not empty.
* Pump House: Remove 1-4 water (to bank) at price shown from 1 chamber the player has a worker in.
* Market: Buy or sell 1-2 times at prices shown. To sell, there must an empty space. To buy, there must be a cube.
* Town Square: Get 1zł from bank.
* Castle: Put a miner in line to fill an order.
After visiting a building with an assistant, other than the castle, give the assistant 1zł from the bank.

#### Pass.
If a player passes twice on a turn, wake all of the player’s tired miners.

### End of Phase
The phase ends after the round in which the fifth royal order is filled (fourth in a 2-player game).  
Return all miners to their players, including those in assistant spaces, in the castle, or in the mine.  
Miners that were tired are woken.  
Remove uncompleted orders from the game.  
Remove unsold tools from the game.  
Turn used tools face-up.  
Pass the starting player marker left.  
If the market has no brown salt, add 1 in the 5zł space. If the market has no green salt, add 1 in the 6zł space.  

### End of Game
The game ends after phase III.  
Each remaining salt is sold to the bank for 3zł.  
Each player’s tool set is sold to the bank using this pricing: 1-2 tools: 2zł total, 3-4 6zł, 5-6 10zł, 7-8 14zł, 9+ 20zł.  
The richest player wins. Ties go in favor of most royal orders filled, then fewest miners, then fewest tools.
